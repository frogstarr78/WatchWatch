Requirements:
 JDIC (for the Tray Icon functionality)
 PostgreSQL-JDBC (database connection layer)


Setup:
	1. Ensure that postgresql is at least listening on localhost 127.0.0.1.
		( The JDBC doesn't work on domain sockets ).
	2. As a user who can create databases and users, run:
	   psql -f schema-up.sql
	   If you have any trouble with this or you want to undo it, run:
	   psql -f schema-down.sql
	3. If your putting this into production, run the schema-clean.sql file:
	   psql -f scheam-clean.sql
